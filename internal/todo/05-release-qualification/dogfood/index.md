# Alpha Dogfood Findings

This index is the mutable backlog for findings discovered while exercising published Ava prereleases. The parent task remains [Dogfood the Alpha and Track Findings](../04-dogfood-alpha-and-track-findings.md).

Dogfooding remains active until the user explicitly declares it complete.

## Current next finding

No dogfood finding is currently pending. Dogfooding remains active and any new realistic-use finding must be added as the next numbered bounded task before it is resolved.

[Avoid redundant routing for conversational follow-ups](12-avoid-redundant-followup-routing.md) is complete. Every request retains the managed-state gate, pure clarifications may be roleless, same-objective scoped follow-ups may retain the already-active role, and new or changed scoped work performs fresh routing.

With the dogfood backlog currently empty, the active Phase 5 roadmap resumes [Build the synthetic v1 qualification vault](../04a-build-synthetic-qualification-vault.md). An empty backlog does not complete dogfooding or authorize release-candidate publication.

## Backlog status

- 0 pending findings
- 0 pending blockers
- 0 pending required-v1 findings
- 12 completed findings

## Backlog rules

- Add every repository finding as the next numbered bounded task.
- Resolve blockers before the next prerelease.
- Mark a finding complete in its implementation PR when code, tests, documentation, indexes, and resolution evidence are complete.
- Keep immutable-release follow-up as a release gate rather than returning implemented work to pending.
- Completed findings remain durable evidence.
- Only the user may complete the parent dogfood task.

Finding 11 requires the next release to prove immutable catalog inheritance, one-edge authoring, multi-source composition, and exact-once semantic guidance against the tagged release. Finding 12 additionally requires realistic multi-turn evidence that full routing occurs only at defined transition points while the finding 07 no-bypass guarantee remains intact.
